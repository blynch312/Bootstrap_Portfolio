                <p>Hi! My name is Brian Lynch and I am a 26 year old student at UNCC in the Full Stack Development program!
                    As a former web designer I was always envious of the skills and talents of the developers that I drew
                    mock-ups for. However, I am excited to finally have the chance to become a developer myself and pursue
                    a dream of becoming a Full Stack Developer!</p>
                <p>Born and raised in Wilmington, North Carolina, I enjoyed a life on the coast of southern NC. As I got older,
                    I realized there was not much of an opportunity for myself to grow into a career that I wanted, so I
                    moved to Charlotte to attend Central Piedmont Community College to study engineering. Although I came
                    from a family of Engineers, it never felt right for me as my studies progressed. But after learning about
                    the UNC Charlotte Full Stack Boot Camp, I knew this was what I wanted to do. Although this course will
                    probably be the hardest thing I have ever done in my life, I am excited to be apart of it and look forward
                    to the challenges ahead! </p>
